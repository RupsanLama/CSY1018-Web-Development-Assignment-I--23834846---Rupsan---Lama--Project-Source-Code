                            In learning about the web development module, I have learned a lot. I anticipated it would be more difficult for me, but once I started using it, it was easy as pie.I found it to be rather challenging at first because I had to learn new terms.I learned briefly from the module that we would be using HTML and CSS.My understanding of the subject up to this point is that html mostly refers to the content of web pages and that CSS is used to style them.Through using Microsoft Studio Code, I gained knowledge about how to code.I still have a lot to learn, but what I have discovered thus far has been exciting. The web development journey thus far has been enjoyable.

                            We were given a project by the university that required us to create a portfolio website. And I was aware that this was my chance to put my coding skills to work.I started by establishing how I wanted my portfolio to look once it was finished.My website's backdrop is pink. I selected pink since I didn't want it to be overly bright or complicated.I'm obsessed with pink, and it blends in so well with the other colors.As you can see, I made my navigation bar seem straightforward and cut out the hover effect.I chose a sans serif font to adhere to my idea of keeping my website basic.I didn't pick the same color for each, instead picking a variety that complemented the page. I started experimenting with the colors and applied them.I didn't use any animation because I wanted it to be straightforward.I added hovers and box shadows simply to enhance the aesthetics of my stuff.

                            Everything proceeded smoothly with the support of the instructor and other social media platforms like YouTube.Began from zero and have since learnt a small amount, but have gained some knowledge of the module.

                            First things first: we were anxious because this was our first project. When working on projects, there were numerous issues.I initially believed coding to be simpler, but I eventually realized it was the hardest work. Everything must be properly coded and the codes must be closed.It worked with the aid of my tutor and a few of my pals. I sought advice from YouTube when git hub initially proved unsuccessful.Also difficult was being responsive. That took the longest because everything had to work flawlessly, including mobile phones.

                            I can now actually put my understanding of computer languages, including how to use github, to create and design websites using my web development talents.I ran into a lot of issues while building the website, but I was able to solve them. I also learned the value of the frame and many other design-related aspects.
