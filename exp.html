                                For the past 2 years I had started my vlog. Discovering new dishes and having a taste is also one of my hobbies. So, I used to create vlogs about foods and their reviews. You can also visit my youtube channel named as <span>Feed ur Hunger</span>. It was a lot of fun while following our own passion. I didn't have a broad knowledge about it but also it was going very well.I'm really happy cauz, I got a chance to connect with people through foods.
